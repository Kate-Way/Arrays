# Arrays - LeetCode solutions

# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example: 
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

# 11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store (you may not slant the container).
Example:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We have two special characters: The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
Examples:
bits = [1,1,0,1,1,1,0] False
bits = [1,1,0] True
