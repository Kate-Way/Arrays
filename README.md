# Arrays - LeetCode solutions

# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example: 
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

# 11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store (you may not slant the container).
Example:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

# 35. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

# 189. Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We have two special characters: The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
Examples:
bits = [1,1,0,1,1,1,0] False
bits = [1,1,0] True
